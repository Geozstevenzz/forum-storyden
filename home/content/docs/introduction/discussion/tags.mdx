Tags are labels that help organize and discover content across the platform. They can be applied to threads and pages to group related content, improve searchability and make exploring the community like going down a wikipedia rabbithole!

## How Tags Work

1. **Tag Creation**: Tags can be created manually by members during authoring of threads or automatically suggested by generative AI.
2. **Tag Application**: Tags can be applied to threads or library pages during creation or editing.
3. **Tag Discovery**: All tags are listed on the tags page which shows how many pieces of content each tag is used on.

## Automatic Tag Suggestions

When optional AI features are enabled, semantic analysis is used to suggest relevant tags for content. This can be used when creating library pages which can speed up creating directories of community content or link lists.

## Best Practices for Using Tags

- Use concise and descriptive tags, one or two words separated by hyphens.
- Avoid overly generic or overly specific tags to ensure broader usability.
- Regularly review and update tags to maintain content relevance and remove offensive tags.
