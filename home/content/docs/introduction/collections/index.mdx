description: Curate and collect content across the community.

Collections allow members to organise their favourite content from a Storyden site into folders. Threads and Pages may be added to collections and collections themselves have titles, descriptions and cover images. Just like other content in Storyden, collections can be shared and interlinked via the Datagraph.
