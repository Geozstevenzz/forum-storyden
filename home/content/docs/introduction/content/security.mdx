The HTML content is sanitized on the server to prevent XSS attacks using the [microcosm-cc/bluemonday](https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday) package. The only exceptions to the built in policy are:

- `data` attributes
- `sdr:` scheme for anchor tags

It also means frontend implementations (webapps, mobile apps) are free to include any custom data attributes in the HTML content. This can be useful for adding custom styling or functionality.

`class` attributes are not allowed and will be removed.
