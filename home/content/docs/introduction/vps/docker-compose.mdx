description: Setting up a Storyden container with Docker Compose
---

This guide will get you set up with a Storyden instance behind [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). There are various additional optional dependencies for Storyden which are covered later, but for now we'll start simple with SQLite.

Prerequisites:

- A Linux server
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A domain name pointing at your server.

<Callout>We'll use the domain `secret-agent.club` for the docs.</Callout>

## With Caddy

This configuration will set up a simple Storyden instance that's production-ready and uses Caddy as a reverse proxy.

First, create `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  storyden:
    image: ghcr.io/southclaws/storyden:latest
    expose:
      - "8000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/storyden/data
    environment:
      - PUBLIC_WEB_ADDRESS=https://secret-agent.club
      - PUBLIC_API_ADDRESS=https://secret-agent.club

  caddy:
    image: caddy:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config

volumes:
  caddy_data:
  caddy_config:
```

Then configure `Caddyfile` to use your domain name and reverse-proxy to the `storyden` container.

```nginx title="Caddyfile"
secret-agent.club {
  reverse_proxy storyden:8000
}
```

Run the stack and once Caddy has set up your SSL certificate, visit your new Storyden site in your browser!

```sh
docker compose up -d
```
