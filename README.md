## What can it do

> https://www.storyden.org/docs/introduction/what-is-storyden

Storyden is a modern forum, wiki and community hub. Like the internet forums of the past, but with a fresh coat of paint and modern security, deployment and intelligence features. A discussion forum, a Notion workspace and your own Reddit platform all rolled into one. Your community can use it for discussion, sharing links or building a directory of knowledge or structured data.

It's open source, [super easy to self host](https://www.storyden.org/docs/introduction/vps) and an homage to the 2000s internet!

## Why

> https://www.storyden.org/blog/building-running-administrating-modern-forum-software

The short version is: most forums are decades old, insecure, abandoned or just not pretty. Storyden aims to solve all of that with a modern language, simple deployment and beautiful design.
