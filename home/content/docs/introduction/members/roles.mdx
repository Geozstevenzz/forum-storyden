Roles in Storyden are modelled loosely on Discord roles, so if you're used Discord you'll feel right at home.

You can use Roles to control access to certain features via [Permissions](/docs/introduction/members/permissions), or just as a way to group members and give their profile some flair via colours and badges.

## Default roles

There are two default roles which cannot be changed:

- **Member**: This is the default role for all members. It has a set of pre-determined permissions such as posting threads and reading published content.
- **Admin**: This is a special role that has all permissions, only assign it to those you trust as it has desctuctive powers.

## Creating custom roles

You can create custom roles to group members together and assign them specific permissions. Each role has:

- **Name**: The name of the role. This is displayed on their profile as well as on the public Roles page.
- **Colour**: The colour of the role. This is used to colour the Role badge.
- **Permissions**: The [permissions](/docs/introduction/members/permissions) assigned to the role. Permissions are additive, meaning if a member has multiple roles, they will have all the permissions of all their roles. You cannot currently create roles that remove permissions or mask permissions from other roles.

## Badges

Members can choose a single role to be their "Badge" which will be displayed next to their name across the site.

## Customising the **Member** role

<Callout type="warn">
  At this time, customising the **Member** role is not available. This is a
  feature we are working on and will be available in the future. This will allow
  you to do things such as run invite-only communities or use Storyden as a
  newsletter/blogging platform where only certain members can create threads but
  members can reply.
