title: Local development
---

To run Storyden locally via the repository, it's pretty easy! You can use this approach for testing, experimenting and contributing.

For full development and contribution documentation, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden).

## Prerequisites

To run Storyden locally, you need to have the following installed:

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl) - the API is written in Go!
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - the frontend is built with Next.js
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - the package manager for the frontend

<Callout>
  If anything is missing from this list, please hit edit this page or [open an
  issue!](https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden/issues/new)
</Callout>

## Go

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden.git
```

From inside the Storyden directory, you can then run the API service:

```sh
go run ./cmd/backend
```

This will start the API server with default configuration. You'll get:

- `./data/data.db` SQLite database
- `./data/assets` to store assets (avatars, images, files, etc.)
- A local server running at `http://localhost:8000`
- OpenAPI documentation at `http://localhost:8000/api/docs`
- CORS and cookie rules configured to support localhost

You can also run the frontend service:

```sh
cd web
yarn
yarn dev
```

<Callout>
  Please note that currently, Storyden's web frontend does not support Next.js
  `--turbo` due to some minor issues with Panda CSS.
</Callout>

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and will by default automatically connect to the API at `http://localhost:8000`.
