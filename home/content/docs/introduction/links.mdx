Have you ever found yourself searching a Discord or WhatsApp chat for a link you shared with someone? Or maybe you want to share a link with someone but can't remember where you found it? This is where the links feature comes in handy.

All websites shared in [Threads](/docs/introduction/discussion/threads) or connected to [Library Pages](/docs/introduction/library) are automatically indexed and searchable on the Links screen.

Storyden indexes basic metadata about websites as well as parts of the main content. It's almost like having your own little Google just for your community!
