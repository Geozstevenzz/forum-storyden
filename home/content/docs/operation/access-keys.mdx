description: API authentication using access keys
---

Access keys provide secure API authentication for Storyden. They allow programmatic access to almost all API endpoints.

Keys are provided as `Authorization` header bearer tokens that authenticate API requests. Each key inherits the permissions of the user who created it and provides a secure alternative to session-based authentication for scripts, applications, and integrations.

## Permissions Required

Not every member can create access keys. Administrators must first grant the `USE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_KEYS` permission via a role before a member can create access keys for their account. Members with the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission inherit the access key usage permission automatically.

## Creating Access Keys

### Via Web Interface

1. Navigate to your account settings
2. Click on "Access Keys"
3. Click "New" to create a new key
4. Provide a descriptive name (e.g., "Discord Bot", "n8n Agent")
5. Optionally set an expiry date
6. Copy the generated secret - **this is the only time you'll see it**

### Key Properties

- **Name**: Descriptive identifier for the key
- **Secret**: The authentication token (shown only once, never stored by Storyden's code)
- **Expiry**: Optional expiration date
- **Enabled**: Whether the key is active or revoked

## Using Access Keys

Include your access key in API requests using the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_key_here" \
  https://your-storyden-instance.com/api/threads
```

<Callout type="info">
  A small number of API operations cannot be invoked with an access key. This
  includes the `AccessKeyCreate` (`POST /api/auth/access-keys`) operation which
  means access keys cannot be used to create more access keys.
</Callout>

## Managing Access Keys

### Member Management

Members with the `USE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_KEYS` permission can:

- Create new access keys for their own account
- View their own keys (name, creation date, expiry, enabled status)
- Revoke their own keys

### Admin Management

Administrators can:

- View all access keys across the instance
- See which user created each key
- Revoke any access key

## Security Best Practices

### Key Management

- Use descriptive names to identify key purposes
- Set expiry dates for temporary access
- Revoke unused keys immediately

### Integration Security

- Store keys securely (environment variables, secret managers)
- Never commit keys to version control
- Use different keys for different applications
- Rotate keys periodically
