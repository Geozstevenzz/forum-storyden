title: Plugins
---

Plugins are currently in-progress. But here's a little preview:

- WebAssembly is the technology of choice: this provides secure sandboxing for running untrusted code while providing flexibility of language choice and easy local testing.
- They will be simple, single files, easy to share, build and install - there will be a marketplace to publish and discover plugins.
- Plugins will provide the ability to intercept operations, run scheduled jobs, connect to third-party systems and more.

More will be shared via the blog, Discord and GitHub
