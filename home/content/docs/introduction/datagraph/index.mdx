description: The fabric that binds content together.
---

This refers to the network of connected content within Storyden. It's best thought of as an overlay to the primitives such as threads, library pages, member profiles, indexed links, collections and everything else. It's the fabric that binds everything together in a way that facilitates searching, exploring and organising content.

The Storyden web application does not expose this term to users but it's a powerful tool used in the internals for providing features such as semantic search and recommendations.
