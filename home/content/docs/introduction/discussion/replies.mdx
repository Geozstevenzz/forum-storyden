description: How the conversation flows.

Replies are the building blocks of conversation in Storyden. When members participate in a thread, they create replies that form ongoing discussion. Unlike traditional forums where responses are always linear, Storyden allows members to reply directly to specific messages, similar to Reddit or Hacker News.

Replies support rich text formatting, allowing members to express themselves with basics like bold, italic, headings, etc. as well as links, images, and more. Community managers can set permissions around who can reply to threads, and moderation tools make it easy to keep conversations healthy.

Each reply can receive [reactions](/docs/introduction/discussion/reacts) from other members, providing a lightweight way to acknowledge or appreciate contributions without creating a new reply.

Replies cannot have tags however and they do not have titles.
