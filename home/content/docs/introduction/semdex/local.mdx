title: With local vector DB
description: A local embedded vector database for testing.

The Semdex can be used with a local embedded vector database for testing purposes. This is useful for development and testing, but not recommended for production use as it gets very slow with large (10k+) datasets.

See configuration details [here](/docs/operation/configuration#semdex).
