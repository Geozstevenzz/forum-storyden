description: The Storyden semantic search index.
---

The Semdex (semantic+index) is a powerful feature built into the core of Storyden. It's powered by embedding vectors and large language models and provides features like semantic search, recommendations and algorithmic feeds.

You can configure the Semdex via [environment variables](/docs/operation/configuration#semdex) in order to enable it. Please note that using the Semdex requires making API calls to local or hosted language models in order to generate embedding vectors for content. Operations like semantic search and recommendations do not cost API calls however as they happen within both Storyden's core itself or your chosen vector database.
