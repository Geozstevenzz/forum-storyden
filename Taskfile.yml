      Yields the next version number for a new release. Will update all relevant
      files with the new version number. These files include:
        - openapi.yaml specification
        - package.json for the frontend
        - version.go for the backend
      Due to the fact generated files also contain the version, this will also
      trigger the codegen task to regenerate all of the related files.

      Example: v1.25.1

    prompt:
      - "Current version: {{.CURRENT_VERSION}} Next version: {{.NEXT_VERSION}} | Write new version to relevant files?"

      After a tagged release, we write a version number again to the relevant
      files to indicate they are canary builds. This happens after the actual
      commit and tag have been created with the "next" version number and is 
      there to ensure commits that land on `main` *after* a tagged release are
      still identifiable as canary builds.

      Example: 1.25.1-canary

      Canary version numbers are NOT used as git tags. They are only used in
      files to indicate the current commit or running version is not stable.
    cmds:
      - go run ./version.go -w -c
      - git add .
      - git commit -m "Post-release {{.CURRENT_VERSION}}"

  release:
    desc: >
      Creates a new release by committing the changes made by the `version` task
      and tagging the commit with the new version number. This does not however
      push the changes or create the GitHub release resource itself. You must
      do that separately as well as write a user-oriented change log for it.
    deps: [version]
    cmds:
      - git add .
      - git commit -m "Release {{.NEXT_VERSION}}"
      - git tag {{.NEXT_VERSION}}
      - task release:post

  release:undo:
    desc: >
      Undoes the last release by deleting the last tag and resetting the working
      directory to the state before the release commit.
    cmds:
      - git reset --hard HEAD~1
      - git tag -d {{.CURRENT_VERSION}}
