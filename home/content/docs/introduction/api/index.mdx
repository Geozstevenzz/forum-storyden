Storyden is [architected as an API-driven](/blog/the-architecture-of-modern-forum-software) system. The API provides full access to every piece of functionality. You may use this to automate certain operations or you can build an entirely custom frontend for the web, mobile or integrate into your existing software, game or anything!

Full API documentation is in the works, but for now you can browse the OpenAPI spec [here](https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden/blob/main/api/openapi.yaml).
