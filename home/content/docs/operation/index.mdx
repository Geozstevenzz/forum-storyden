Controlling and customising your installation is done via two methods which depend on the kind of changes you want to make.

There are two ways to customise Storyden to your needs:

<Cards>
  <Card href="/docs/operating/configuration" title="Configuration">
    refers to environment variables passed to the application at startup time.
    The kinds of things under configuration don't change very often once set, so
    they require a restart to take effect.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/docs/operating/settings" title="Settings">
    refer to changes you can make via the administration menu inside the app
    itself. These are the kinds of things you'll likely want to experiment with
    so these are stored in the database and can be changed at any time.
