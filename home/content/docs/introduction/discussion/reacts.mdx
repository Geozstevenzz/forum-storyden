Members can react to [replies](/docs/introduction/discussion/replies) with emoji expressions. Reactions provide a quick and lightweight way for users to acknowledge or respond to content without having to write a full reply.

Reactions are displayed underneath replies, showing both the emoji and the number of people who reacted with that emoji. Currently, Storyden supports standard emoji reactions, with plans to introduce a more comprehensive custom emoji system in the future.
