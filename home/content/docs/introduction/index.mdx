<Callout>
  Storyden is in an early research and development phase and we're aiming to get
  as much feedback as possible. Please feel free to share any thoughts,
  experiences, bugs or suggestions on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden) or via this form:

## Quickstart

Start your stopwatch, let's get a community up and running in record time!

Storyden values modern approaches and simplicity. The best way to try it out is spin up a local instance with Docker:

```sh
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/southclaws/storyden
```

This will make Storyden accessible at `http://localhost:8000` for you to play around with.

From here, you can register a new account and explore the platform.

## Deploying

Storyden runs anywhere Docker containers do. Deploy to production on your own hardware, a VPS or Fly.io:
