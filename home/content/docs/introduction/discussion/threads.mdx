Threads are the backbone of discussion on Storyden.

Every thread has:

- A title
- A body (stored as HTML, but written with WYSIWYG)
- A single [category](/docs/introduction/discussion/categories)
- An optional list of [tags](/docs/introduction/discussion/tags)

Once posted, others can reply to your thread. You can also edit any aspect of your thread except its permanent URL slug, also known as a [Mark](/docs/introduction/marks).
