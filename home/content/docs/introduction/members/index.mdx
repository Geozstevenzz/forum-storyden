Everyone who signs up to your Storyden site is a member. It's like being part of a cool club.

Members can customise their profile like most social platforms. Avatar, bio, display name and unique handle.

Display names are not unique and mostly unrestricted in what characters are allowed. Handles are your typical @ unique username, URL-safe so only certain characters are allowed. However, unlike most platforms, Storyden does not limit what language/writing system members can use for their handle. Punctuation however is not allowed.

A member's public profile displays their details, some statistics, their [Roles](/docs/introduction/members/roles), and their content. Content is grouped into threads they have posted and collections they curate.
