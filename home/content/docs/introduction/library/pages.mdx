---

At the heart of any library are the pages held within. The custodian of knowledge available to all.

Storyden's Pages are malleable yet structured, facilitating a rich network of connected content. Each page has:

- Title
- Description
- URL slug (unique across all pages, can be edited)
- Assets - a list of images associated with the page itself
- Link (optional) - an external URL for associating the page with another website
- Primary image (optional) - a large cover image which is also used for social previews
- HTML-based content
- Author
- Parent node - if the page is a child of another page in the tree
- Tags - just like threads can have tags, pages can too!
- Visibility status - visibility determines whether a page is published, draft, review or unlisted

## SEO Ready

In the age of GPTs, does SEO matter any more? Who knows, but Storyden provides SEO-ready pages anyway. All the standard tags are generated, as well as OpenGraph preview images.

Web pages in Storyden are also always server-side rendered, optimised for speed and crawlers.
