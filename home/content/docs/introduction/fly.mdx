description: Setting up a Storyden instance on Fly.io in under 5 minutes!
---

Fly.io is a platform for running Docker containers on a global network of edge servers. It's a great fit for Storyden because it's container-native and super simple to get started!

![A rocket sitting on the launch pad](/docs/introduction/fly/start_your_engines.png)

## Deployment

Relevant documentation: https://fly.io/docs/apps/launch

<Callout>
  Fly.io will update their UI and CLI from time to time, so the examples in this
  documentation may fall out of date. In general, the process should remain
  roughly the same but if you spot a major difference, please let us know by
  [opening an issue!](https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden/issues/new)
</Callout>

Create a new directory for your configuration and `cd` into it in your terminal.

```sh
cd storyden-fly-example
```

Once you've created an account on Fly.io and set up the CLI, you can launch a Storyden instance with a single command:

```sh
fly launch --image ghcr.io/southclaws/storyden --name storyden --internal-port 8000
```

- `--image` is the Docker image to use. This is the latest version of Storyden from the GitHub Container Registry.
- `--name` is the name of the app. This will be used to generate a URL for your app.
- `--internal-port` is the port that the app runs on _inside_ the container. This is 8000 by default.

You'll see a confirmation of the app name, region, organisation, etc:

```yaml
❯ fly launch --image ghcr.io/southclaws/storyden --name storyden --internal-port 8000
Using image ghcr.io/southclaws/storyden
Creating app in D:\Work\storyden-fly-example
We're about to launch your app on Fly.io. Here's what you're getting:

Organization: Your Name              (fly launch defaults to the personal org)
Name:         my-storyden            (specified on the command line)
Region:       London, United Kingdom (this is the fastest region for you)
App Machines: shared-cpu-1x, 1GB RAM (most apps need about 1GB of RAM)
Postgres:     <none>                 (not requested)
Redis:        <none>                 (not requested)
Tigris:       <none>                 (not requested)
```

Storyden idles at around ~80MB of RAM so 1GB is plenty and should support a small to medium sized community.

<Callout>
  Storyden is written in Go which is a garbage-collected language, usage *will*
  increase based on the features you enable, the amount of traffic and the
  average size of content being processed. Keep an eye on Fly.io's grafana
  dashboards to track memory usage and scale up if necessary.
</Callout>

`fly launch` will open a browser window to confirm settings, make sure the internal port is set to 8000. Once you've confirmed, after a short time you'll see:

```
Waiting for launch data... Done
Created app 'my-storyden' in organization 'personal'
Admin URL: https://fly.io/apps/my-storyden
Hostname: my-storyden.fly.dev
Wrote config file fly.toml
Validating D:\Work\storyden-fly-example\fly.toml
✓ Configuration is valid
==> Building image

...

Visit your newly deployed app at https://my-storyden.fly.dev/
```

Fly.io will also generate a `fly.toml` file for you in the current directory. We'll use this in the next section to make Storyden production-ready.

For now though, admire your brand new instance of Storyden!

![Storyden running on Fly.io!](/docs/introduction/fly/browser_fly.png)

You can visit the URL that Fly.io gives you and you'll see your Storyden instance - _almost_ ready to use!

## Necessary configuration

That's only half the story though. You have an instance but

1. it's entirely **ephemeral**! This means that if the instance is restarted, it will lose all its data.
2. it has no idea what its public address is! This means session cookies won't work.

For this section, we'll be working with the `fly.toml` file that was generated when you ran `fly launch`. This file is used by Fly.io to configure your app. It'll look something like this:

```toml title="fly.toml"
app = 'my-storyden'
primary_region = 'lhr'

[build]
  image = 'ghcr.io/southclaws/storyden'

[http_service]
  internal_port = 8000
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = 'stop'
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
  processes = ['app']

[[vm]]
  memory = '1gb'
  cpu_kind = 'shared'
  cpus = 1
```

<Callout>
  Over time the defaults may change and what you see in your `fly.toml` file may
  be different to what's here. Please refer to the [Fly.io
  documentation](https://fly.io/docs/) for additional guidance.
</Callout>

### Persistent storage

Relevant documentation: https://fly.io/docs/volumes

To create a volume for the SQLite database, assets and other persisted data, we need to create a Fly volume:

```sh
fly volumes create storyden_data -r lhr -n 2
```

What this means:

- `storyden_data` is the name of the volume. This is what we'll use to mount it in the `fly.toml` file.
- `-r lhr` is the region to create the volume in. This should be the same region as your app.
- `-n 2` is the number of replicas to create, in this example we're using 2 because by default, `fly launch` creates two replicas of the app's machine.

To finish up, we need to mount the volume to the app by using the `[mounts]` section of `fly.toml`.

```diff title="fly.toml"
    app = 'my-storyden'
    primary_region = 'lhr'

    [build]
      image = 'ghcr.io/southclaws/storyden'

    [http_service]
      internal_port = 8000
      force_https = true
      auto_stop_machines = 'stop'
      auto_start_machines = true
      min_machines_running = 0
      processes = ['app']

    [[vm]]
      memory = '1gb'
      cpu_kind = 'shared'
      cpus = 1
+
+   [mounts]
+     source="storyden_data"
+     destination="/storyden/data"
```

Run Fly Deploy to attach the volume:

```sh
fly deploy
```

### Environment Variables

Relevant documentation: https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration#the-env-variables-section

Storyden uses secure cookies for session authentication. As a result, it needs to know what domain it's running on so it can set the `Domain` flag on the cookie.

```diff title="fly.toml"
    app = 'my-storyden'
    primary_region = 'lhr'

    [build]
      image = 'ghcr.io/southclaws/storyden'

    [http_service]
      internal_port = 8000
      force_https = true
      auto_stop_machines = 'stop'
      auto_start_machines = true
      min_machines_running = 0
      processes = ['app']

    [[vm]]
      memory = '1gb'
      cpu_kind = 'shared'
      cpus = 1

    [mounts]
      source="storyden_data"
      destination="/storyden/data"
+
+   [env]
+     PUBLIC_API_ADDRESS = "https://my-storyden.fly.dev"
+     PUBLIC_WEB_ADDRESS = "https://my-storyden.fly.dev"
```

#### The `PUBLIC_API_ADDRESS` and `PUBLIC_WEB_ADDRESS` variables

The [public API address](/docs/operation/configuration#public_api_address) and [public web address](/docs/operation/configuration#public_web_address) variables are necessary for Storyden to manage sessions using cookies and a few other things such as knowing where links should point to.

In the above section, when you ran `fly launch`, it gives you the URL of your app. This URL will look something like:

```
https://my-storyden.fly.dev
```

It's a subdomain of `fly.dev` and is uniquely generated based on your app name. You can refer to the [Fly.io domains documentation](https://fly.io/docs/networking/custom-domain/) for information on setting up a custom domain.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  For this quick start guide, your instance is all hosted on a single domain,
  that means the API and the frontend both run on `https://my-storyden.fly.dev`.
  But if you're using separate backend and frontend deployments (hosting the
  frontend on Vercel for example) it's necessary that both share the same root
  domain. So you'd put the API on something like `api.mycommunity.com` and the
  frontend on `mycommunity.com`. Cookies will be issued to the root domain,
  `mycommunity.com` in this example and will be included in requests to both the
  API and the frontend's SSR rendering backend if you're using a framework such
  as Next.js.
</Callout>

Once you've set these two environment variables, plus anything else from the [configuration](/docs/operation/configuration), you can now re-deploy the app:

```sh
fly deploy
```

And that's it! You now have your own Storyden instance running on Fly.io!
