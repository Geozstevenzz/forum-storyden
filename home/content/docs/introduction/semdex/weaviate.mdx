title: With Weaviate
---

For production use, one option is [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) which is a self-hosted or cloud-hosted vector database with built-in embedding features.

Currently, the class name of the Weaviate instance is tightly bound to the OpenAI configuration within Storyden. This will be made more flexible in the future.

This means that Storyden only supports two Weaviate modules: `text2vec-transformers` for locally hosted (GPU-required) or `text2vec-openai` for OpenAI (API key required).

See configuration details [here](/docs/operation/configuration#semdex).
