title: Autofill
description: Autofill resource properties using language models.
---

Being built with AI at the core, Storyden has a few powerful time-saving tools for automatically suggesting and filling certain properties of resources.

These features can be enabled by [configuring a language model provider](/docs/operation/configuration#language_model_provider) but does not require configuring the Semdex (vector database.)

Autofill features are available for various APIs and through the UI.

## UI

When editing a Library Page, if a [language model provider](/docs/operation/configuration#language_model_provider) is configured, you will buttons to autofill various properties of the page. The supported properties are:

- Title
- Tags
- Import from URL

These buttons are on the right hand side of the inputs during edit mode:

"Import" will attempt to import everything from the provided link. This will set a title, tags, description and summarised content based on the web page.

## API

### Fill rules

When making a `PATCH` call to a node, you can provide

- `title_fill_rule`
- `tag_fill_rule`
- `content_fill_rule`

These will return a suggestion for the respective property. The client is responsible for prompting the user to accept and apply the suggestion to the node.

### Autofill a Node from a URL

You can use the `fill_source=url` to autofill a node from a URL. This will set the title, tags and content of the node based on the web page.

### Autofill a Node from an Asset

Setting `content_fill_rule` while creating an asset will automatically create or update a Library Node with the asset's content. Currently, only PDF files are supported. Text will be extracted, summarised and used as the content for the node.

See the OpenAPI spec for more information and details on the behaviour of the autofill rules.
