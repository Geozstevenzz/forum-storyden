title: Permissions
description: Storyden provides a set of permissions for granular access control via Roles.
---

Permissions are how members are granted access to certain features. They are assigned to [Roles](/docs/introduction/members/roles), which are then assigned to [Members](/docs/introduction/members). This allows for granular access control and the ability to group members together.
