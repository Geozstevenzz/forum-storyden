> TL;DR: Storyden now lets you customize permissions for your default member role and even control what guests (non-logged-in users) can access. Build invite-only communities, public knowledge bases, or anything your imagination dreams up.

Picture this: you're running a book club and want members to discuss freely, but you also want the world to browse your carefully curated reading lists. Or maybe you're building a private community where even browsing requires an invitation. 

Up until now, Storyden had fairly rigid permission structures. Everyone who signed up got the same set of default permissions, and guests? Well, they couldn't do much of anything.

That changes today.

  **What's new?** You can now edit permissions for your default member role and the guest role. This means you control exactly what new members can do when they join, and what visitors can see before they even create an account.

## Your community, your rules

The new permission system gives you two powerful levers:

**Default Member Role**: Every person who registers gets this role automatically. Previously hardcoded, now completely customizable. Want new members to only read and react until they prove themselves? Done. Want them to dive straight into creating content? Also done.

**Guest Role**: The invisible role that every non-logged-in visitor carries. Want guests to browse your public knowledge base but not see discussions? Perfect. Want everything locked down until they create an account? Easy.

## Real-world use cases that just became possible

### The Invite-Only Think Tank

Remove posting permissions from the guest role entirely. Guests can't see threads, can't browse your directory, can't even see who's in the community. Your Storyden becomes a completely private space where only invited members can participate.

Members still get full access to create, discuss, and build your collective knowledge base. But the outside world? They see a simple login page.

### The Public Knowledge Commons

Flip it around: give guests read access to your library and directory but keep discussions member-only. Your community becomes a public resource that anyone can benefit from, while the actual conversation remains among your trusted circle.

Perfect for research groups, professional associations, or any community that wants to share knowledge publicly while keeping strategy discussions private.

### The Graduated Access Community

Start new members with limited permissions - maybe they can read and react but not create new posts. As they prove themselves valuable contributors, manually assign them additional roles with expanded permissions.

This lets you build trust gradually while preventing drive-by spam or low-effort content from day-one members.

### The Collaborative Directory

Give everyone - including guests - permission to submit items to your directory but keep thread creation restricted to members. Build a public resource where anyone can contribute links, tools, or information, but meaningful discussions happen among your registered community.

## How it feels to use

From an admin perspective, editing these default roles feels natural. Head to your role management page and you'll see the familiar "Member" role listed alongside any custom roles you've created. But unlike before, you can click edit and adjust exactly which permissions new members receive.

The guest role is even simpler - it just works. Every request that hits your Storyden without a valid session automatically gets evaluated against the guest role permissions. No special configuration needed.

For your community members, the experience is seamless. They might notice they can suddenly do more (or less) than before, but the interface adapts naturally to show only the actions they're permitted to take.

## Under the hood (for the technically curious)

If you're wondering how this works, the short version is that Storyden now treats authentication and authorization as separate concerns. Every request - authenticated or not - gets a session context with associated roles and permissions.

The default member role (ID: `00000000000000000010`) can now be customized through the standard role management APIs. When you edit it, Storyden creates a database record that overrides the hardcoded defaults. No custom edit? It falls back to the original behavior.

Guest sessions automatically receive whatever permissions you've configured for the guest role, enabling the same authorization logic to work seamlessly across all user types.

The permission system itself operates on a simple allowlist model: if a user's combined roles include a required permission, the action is allowed. Otherwise, it's blocked with an appropriate error.

Session-based authorization replaced the previous account-based checking, which enables this unified model to work for guests (who have no account) and members alike. The code paths are identical whether you're logged in or not.

## What this enables moving forward

This foundation unlocks so many possibilities we haven't even built yet. Imagine time-limited roles that automatically expire, permission-based onboarding flows, or integration with external systems that grant roles based on membership in other platforms.

The technical architecture supports much more sophisticated access patterns than we've exposed in the UI today. But starting with these two fundamental roles - member and guest - gives every community the building blocks to create their perfect balance of openness and privacy.

## Try it out

Whether you're running a public community that wants to experiment with guest access, or a private group that needs more control over member permissions, fire up the latest Storyden and head to your role management page.

The member role is right there waiting to be customized. And that guest role? It's working in the background, ready for whatever permissions you decide to grant.
